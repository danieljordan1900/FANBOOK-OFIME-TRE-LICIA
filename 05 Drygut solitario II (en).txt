It was very cold that morning. He could feel it deep in his heart.

Sleepy and wrapped in darkness, he opened his eyes in the middle of the gloom. Everything was hazy; a layer of frost covered his eyelids. After shaking his head and sneezing, young Drygut could see more clearly the bleak surroundings that enclosed him.

A pale bluish light illuminated the inside of the nest. Around him, amidst a clutter of feathers and dry leaves, he could make out his brothers and sisters sleeping together, huddled as closely as possible to maintain their body warmth. Not far off, his mother, visible as a vigilant silhouette, was also sleeping, but standing near the entrance of their home.

From that very entrance, a circular opening in the stone sealed with a crude piece of poorly fitted wood, the growing glow of the new day seeped through. From the dim interior of the nest, the daylight appeared as an irregular and beautiful ring of sky-blue light amidst the shadows.

But it wasn’t just the light that crept through the cracks in the makeshift door. At times, a cold draft also invaded the nest.

Invasive and biting, Drygut felt that frigid wind gnawing at his scaly skin, making him shiver and retreat deeper into his feathers. However, despite the harsh environment, he didn’t feel depressed at all. What might be a distressing place for others was a luxury for Drygut and any other hawk-turkey.

Defying their surroundings, his family and the rest of the hawk-turkey colony lived in caves on the walls of a deep, inaccessible canyon, a secluded and secret place that protected them from enemies and offered shelter from the fierce blizzards that battered the Arctic lands of the great north.

The young Drygut, imagining the white and desolate wastelands of those lands in winter, closed his eyes again. A deep drowsiness enveloped him once more. On the brink of resuming his sleep, certain that nothing would interrupt his hibernation, he nestled into the warm plumage of his family surrounding him.

Suddenly, a noise, then another and another... many sounds, like clapping, echoed faintly from outside.

Half-asleep, everyone in the nest began to wake up.

As he finally recognized the sounds, anxiety tightened Drygut’s throat, making him stir restlessly. His siblings also moved uneasily, waking up and stretching their necks. His mother, always vigilant, shook the frost from her feathers and began to remove the logs blocking the entrance, listening intently to the noises outside.

A loud crash, like a boulder falling, suddenly reverberated. Without wasting time, his mother opened the door, briefly letting the freezing wind into their home... and someone else as well.

The nest filled with excited chirps and flapping. Everyone recognized the newcomer and what he had brought with him.

Drygut’s father, an imposing hawk-turkey with sharp eyebrows, still covered in frost and with icicles hanging from his feathers, silently extended one of his large claws and dropped a large, shiny black pear-shaped lump in the middle of the nest.

Drygut and his siblings pounced on the strange body, eager and hungry. They pecked, tore apart, and devoured it right there. Although almost unrecognizable due to its unusual shape, it was a large Arctic fish, rich in fats and proteins—the only food the young hawk-turkeys would have in the middle of winter. A difficult and rare catch that, fortunately for the chicks, Drygut’s father had managed to secure.

The large prey didn’t last long, quickly consumed by the young ones. Meanwhile, in a secluded and intimate corner, Drygut’s father took the opportunity to share food with his mate, offering her small bites of other smaller catches.

Thus, in a growing silence, only interrupted by the dwindling frenzy of the meal, the hawk-turkey family finished feeding without issue.

Soon, Drygut and the other young hawk-turkeys began to frolic again, satisfied. Though they hadn’t eaten enough to be completely full, the concentrated nutrients they had ingested brought on a drowsiness and heaviness that was hard to resist.

In the midst of this relaxed atmosphere, a sudden cry caught everyone’s attention.

“Are you leaving again?!”

“There’s a meeting of leaders in the great cave. It’s important,” Drygut’s father replied to his mate.

“You’re no longer part of them. Why do you have to go?”

“I must... Something serious has happened.”

Drygut’s mother’s expression darkened. Drygut and the other chicks turned their heads, curious and worried about what might be going on. Drygut’s father, noticing their gazes, spread his wings, indicating that what he was about to say was for everyone.

After resting his head on his mate to calm her, he finally spoke.

“The clan leader’s son has died.”

A deathly silence filled the space.

“Draga? How?!” exclaimed Drygut’s mother, shocked. Inside the nest, the young ones cried out in distress at the news. Everyone knew Draga, big and strong, and it was hard to imagine anyone who could face and defeat him in the air. Even harder was the thought that anyone would dare challenge him, given his feared violent and savage temper.

Drygut’s father flapped his wings again, silencing the chicks’ cries.

“He was challenged and lost. That’s how it happened, in front of everyone. It’s a fact under the sky, and it cannot be changed.”

Silence enveloped the nest once more, this time heavier and more suffocating.

“Who challenged him?” Drygut asked, his voice trembling from a corner where he had remained silent until then.

His father, as if reading his son’s fears, spoke the name Drygut had dreaded to hear.

“It was Fathungry.”

The name fell upon them like a heavy stone, darkening everyone’s thoughts in the nest.

“Don’t go,” his mate ordered, her voice now barely a whisper, broken by fear.

“I must go,” the great hawk-turkey responded, his voice firm and unwavering. Without another word, he pushed his mate aside with his large wing and prepared to leave.

But before opening the entrance, he paused for a moment and turned his head to look one last time at the nest he was leaving behind.

His clear eyes settled on his eldest son, Drygut.

“Don’t forget your promise,” he said, his deep voice carrying a weight only fate could bestow... as if those words were the final will of a wise old hawk-turkey.

Drygut, with his heart in his throat, tried to speak, but the words stuck in his throat. His father, without waiting for a response, turned and, opening the nest’s entrance, spread his majestic wings. His silhouette rose into flight, disappearing into the blinding light outside.

None of those present would ever see him fly again.

// -------------

"Father... father... Fatherrrrrr!... Aurhhhhhhg."

Drygut awoke abruptly, his sleep shattered by an overwhelming pressure on his chest. With a spasm, he vomited violently, his body convulsing for minutes before the chills and intense sweat made him calm down a bit. He wasn't well. He knew it.

He could feel the feverish heat under his feathers, the fever spreading like fire inside him. His vision blurred, and a paralyzing dizziness threatened to knock him down. He needed medicine, and he needed it immediately.

With his beak still stained with saliva, he began frantically searching through the feathers of his wings, his anxiety growing alongside his fear of not finding what he needed. Finally, he found it.

A long green ribbon, adorned with small yellow fruits that resembled lemons, slipped from his plumage. Pulling on it with his beak, Drygut tore off one of the fruits and swallowed it in a single gulp.

A wave of intense acidity and a refreshing sensation spread through him. After a few minutes of tense rest, the fever and dizziness began to subside. Gradually, control over his senses returned.

With effort, Drygut stood up, extended his wings, and flapped them slightly, recovered at least in appearance. But there was no miracle in his improvement.

With a somber look, he directed his eyes to the ground where the green ribbon lay. Only five yellow fruits remained.

"Five weeks...," he thought, disheartened, contemplating the little medicine he had left.

His calculations were correct. Those yellow fruits, similar to lemons, were nothing more than medicine capsules, essential for curing any ailment. The pavo-hawks, large raptor-like creatures, were prone to diseases due to their unhygienic nature and constant exposure to parasites. For them, these capsules were a vital antidote, consumed weekly as a preventive measure. Without them, illness or a latent infection would eventually consume them. Adult males like Drygut, who traveled constantly, were the most vulnerable, while adult females only needed them in their old age.

This miraculous medicine was one of the best-kept secrets of their species. Only the clan leader and his close associates could distribute it, thus ensuring control over their own and their medical well-being.

With great care, Drygut began to roll up the green ribbon again, making sure all the capsules were intact and well secured. Losing one in the midst of his exile would mean one less week of life.

After several minutes of adjusting his feathers and ensuring the medicine was well hidden, Drygut felt calmer. He began to observe his surroundings.

A cold wind came from the north, clearing the fog and revealing the rugged, forested mountains that surrounded him.

Reflecting, Drygut fixed his gaze on the horizon, on the great north that peeked between the snowy peaks in the distance.

"Should I return to the great north?" he wondered for a moment but shook his head in denial. He couldn't do it. It was too far, and he didn't have the strength for that journey. Besides, arriving alone, without the rest of the clan, would be an offense to his mother and sisters who still lived there. Perhaps he could obtain some additional medicine if he begged, but when they found out about his exile... where would he go?

He had to take another path. He didn't want to involve his family in his problems. Maybe... if he headed back south.

The wind gradually died down, and the fog began to close in again around him. A foul odor suddenly assaulted him. Looking at the ground where he was, he noticed how ruined his nest was, deteriorated by the rain and soiled by his own vomit. Uninterested in staying there, he decided to leave.

With a powerful flap of his wings, the great bird ran up the steep hill until he rose into the sky, leaving behind the pile of rotten logs that had been his home until then.

// ----------------------

Drygut's flight during the afternoon had been monotonous and gray. The dense fog clung to the valley, oppressive and discouraging for a bird like him, accustomed to a clear view and an open horizon.

Flying over the valley, he found nothing that sparked his interest. The river he followed on his path bathed the shores of small riverside villages, too rural and isolated compared to the one he had raided at dawn. The wooded area offered no farming or trading areas; there was nothing worth eating or stealing.

Taking refuge in those isolated lands was starting to seem like a big mistake. "Maybe if I had traveled further east, where there are large fields of crops, I’d have something better..." Drygut thought, bored. Although he wasn't hungry, thanks to the effects of the medicine he had taken earlier, the lack of activity always made him anxious, and that anxiety led him to eat unnecessarily. In his previous life, before exile, following orders without question was all he did in his spare time.

Now, however, he had to think about everything, and thinking was becoming an unbearable task.

"Father..." Drygut murmured, depressed, as his thoughts returned to memories of his old father.

A wise pavo-hawk among his kind, someone Drygut, being the eldest of his children, had never come close to matching.

"Carry the fire of the divine feather to the next generation..." his father had made him promise. Back then, Drygut had answered enthusiastically, determined to make his family proud.

A promise made in his youth that, now in his adulthood, felt like an impossible goal.

"...the fire of the divine feather..." Drygut pondered. He tried to remember his father's wise advice when everything seemed easier. But now, his inability to think for himself tormented him. The only thing he could cling to were those memories, fading with time. Perhaps in them, he would find the answer to the questions that troubled him so much.

Closing his eyes and letting himself be guided by the wind, Drygut began to imagine those days, to visualize his father flying ahead of him... speaking to him...

"...the fire we carry inside... a will burning like the sun... a flame capable of burning through the steel of a sword... and healing any wound that it causes... it’s the fire that would ignite a divine feather..."

So his father had spoken, but Drygut never understood it, and now he didn’t understand it either. A fire that burned steel and also healed? In his lifetime of migratory travels, no pavo-hawk had ever seen such a thing. It was believed that this fire belonged only to the ancestral dragons, capable of transforming the existing with their breath.

Drygut had never met any of those dragons. Nor did he know where to find them. The dragons he had seen were too young to be called true ancestral dragons.

Frustrated, Drygut opened his eyes and stopped thinking. He knew too little. Thinking so much gave him a headache, but it was the best and only thing he could do at that moment.

He closed his eyes again, willing to try harder to remember, but then something interrupted him. He felt a change in the air... a disturbing change...

With his senses alert, Drygut focused his gaze on the horizon, following the course of the river.

In the distance, a long column of smoke rose into the sky, staining it with brown and gray ink.

Perplexed by that smoke in such a remote area, curiosity overcame Drygut, making him forget his previous worries. Eager to have something else to think about, he flapped his wings excitedly toward the great column of smoke in the distance.

// --------------

"It's a big fire..." Drygut thought, his eyebrows raised and his eyes shining with the crimson reflection of the flames.

Even from the height he was at, he could feel the heat rising from the inferno below. The forest was burning uncontrollably, and the houses and barns of a large riverside village were already engulfed in voracious flames.

From above, Drygut could see the desperate villagers fleeing along the roads out of the town, some on foot, others in carts loaded with their few belongings. Meanwhile, the heart of the village was being consumed by fire, and those who remained were futilely trying to extinguish the flames with strange and large water machines.

For Drygut, watching the chaos from the sky was nothing but pure entertainment.

"Clo, clo, clo, clo," he chuckled in satisfaction, watching the villagers' futile efforts to contain the fire. The flames spread rapidly, engulfing much of the forest. If they didn't hurry, they'd soon be surrounded by the fire.

Circling around the great column of smoke, Drygut looked for something else to amuse himself with.

"Oii Oiiii," he heard a buzz from below. Intrigued, he looked down at the road and saw several villagers abandoning their carts, running in terror.

"Could they have seen the approaching fire?" he thought slowly. But as he watched several of them stop and rear up against the sky, he understood.

The villagers had seen him, and they probably thought he was responsible for the fire. At least, that's what Drygut interpreted from the faint cries that reached him from below.

"Clo, clo, clo, clo," he laughed mockingly again. He didn't know what to make of these small and clumsy creatures, other than that they were incredibly stupid. Turkey-hawks didn't know fire, they didn't use it, though they were resistant to both flames and water. Even so, they had to be careful, which is why Drygut kept his distance from the smoke and tongues of fire.

Then, a dark idea lit up his face.

"But... what if I give them what they're looking for?" he thought maliciously. Drygut wasn't sure how useful it would be to take credit for this blazing disaster, but it could serve as proof to his own kind that he wasn't friendly with small creatures like these villagers.

Without further thought, he sketched out a simple plan in his head and carried it out.

Letting out a long, raspy cry characteristic of his species, Drygut dove towards the villagers, who immediately began running in panic. In a low flight, creating a great wind under his wings, Drygut flew over them three times, causing them to flee in terror, leaving everything behind as they disappeared into the surrounding forest.

Convinced his plan had worked, Drygut puffed out his chest in pride as he laughed again. He felt emboldened by what he had done, and thinking that maybe the villagers were still watching him from the forest, he decided to do one more stunt before leaving.

He descended again towards the fire, this time entering from the smokiest side, determined to surprise anyone on the other side by appearing in the middle of the fire like a blazing phoenix.

It would be an image that none of the villagers would ever forget.

But once inside the fire, Drygut discovered the grave mistake he had made.

Flying low to the ground and enveloped by the thick smoke, the silhouette of a tower suddenly emerged before his eyes. He didn't have time to react. Seconds later, everything went black.

// --------------

When Drygut began to regain consciousness, the world seemed to flow in deep darkness. Gradually, shapes began to take form, and the sound of running water reached his ears.

And then, a voice.

"Wow, that was amazing! I know I keep saying it, but it was amazing, you saved the entire village all by yourself! Am I repeating myself again? But wow!"

The voice kept chattering as Drygut, dazed, noticed he was lying next to the river. He tried to move, but a stabbing pain paralyzed him completely. He looked down, and what he saw filled him with terror.

At his feet, a pile of shattered wood and metal lay scattered on the ground. All splintered and deformed, as if they had been struck by a giant hammer. But the most terrifying sight was the large metal pipe protruding from his feathers, piercing through his chest deep into his body.

"Piu, piu, piu..." Drygut began to panic as he realized the terrible situation he was in. Moments before, he had crashed into something, and now...

Suddenly, a strange creature appeared from under one of his wings. It looked like a... pony?

"Calm down. I know it looks bad, but I can fix it. I've already healed your other wounds, and I'm pretty sure I can handle this one. Just stay calm. Listen to my soothing voice while I work and..." the creature said as it placed its hooves on the metal pipe.

With a yank, it pulled it out.

Drygut, not fully comprehending what was happening, felt unbearable pain emanating from his chest, as if his insides were being emptied. An intense cold took hold of his insides, and his breathing began to falter.

Weakened, Drygut started to close his eyes again, losing consciousness.

"...ok, I was wrong, it doesn't look bad... it looks horrible. But I'm still confident I can help you, friend. This is coming from a Kirin who has taken advanced medical classes in her tribe and is ready to face any challenge that comes her way on her journey around the world. So, while I tell you the story of my life, which I'm sure will keep you keenly interested, haha... I'll take care of you as you deserve... ugh..."

Drygut's consciousness was rapidly fading, and he could barely hear what the Kirin was saying.

"...I was born in... my name is Autumn Blaze... butterflies..."

Everything went black.

"We can't live on promises..."

// ----------

Drygut turned slowly, feeling the cold abyss behind him. He stood on the edge of a steep cliff, where the waves of a turbulent Arctic ocean crashed furiously against the rocks, creating a deafening echo that mingled with the roar of the icy wind.

Behind him, Fathungry, the new Great Leader of the hawk-pheasants' clan, watched him in silence. His serious and distant demeanor contrasted sharply with his usual carefree, comedian's attitude.

"My friend, the winds are changing," Fathungry said, his voice barely a whisper amidst the roar of the sea. "For too long we have clung to old traditions, but it's time to leave them behind."

Drygut did not interrupt, he simply listened.

"I’ve already told everyone else, but I’m telling you in person. This is a pivotal moment for all the hawk-pheasants; we must stand united, now more than ever. We need each other..."

Fathungry's melodious voice occasionally faded amidst the booming sounds of distant glaciers colliding.

"The loss of your father has been a hard blow for the entire clan. I deeply regret it; he was one of the wisest among us, and I don't think I’m wrong in saying he was the wisest of the last generations of our people. His wings and wisdom led him to support my cause, and now that he is gone, he has left me a debt that is difficult to repay."

Drygut remained still, paying close attention to Fathungry’s words. He observed the sharp, cold, and threatening features emerging on the young leader’s face.

The wind paused for a moment, as if it too was waiting to listen, holding still to allow the words to resonate in the air.

"There will be changes in our clan, my friend Drygut, changes that many will find hard to accept…" Fathungry paused; his expression hardened. "However, I give you my word that these changes will not affect you or your family."

Drygut’s heart, which had momentarily stopped, began to beat strongly again.

"Follow my flight, my friend, and I assure you that you will enjoy the same prosperity as all who follow me," Fathungry concluded with a sinister, mocking smile, placing his wing briefly on Drygut’s shoulder.

Drygut did not respond; he simply turned his gaze toward the horizon, where the sky and the sea merged into a vast darkness speckled with icebergs.

Soon after, Fathungry departed, but not before saying a few last words...

Alone on the cliff, facing the icy wind, Drygut kept his eyes fixed on the vast ocean stretching before him, an ocean that slowly faded from his view, just like the imagined image of his father flying on the horizon.

With his eyelids heavy from the snow and ice mixing with his tears, the last light went out in his eyes.

// ----------

"My son, look..."

"You know nothing, you're a fool. Hahaha..."

"It’s tradition... it has been that way, and it will be so afterwards..."

"Did you see that dead monster everyone worships? ... These are its feathers!"

"It will disappear soon... it always happens, but not all of them do..."

"My friend, the winds are changing..."

"The leader’s son is dead."

"...we must stand united, now more than ever. We need each other..."

"Don’t forget your promise..."

"We can’t live on promises..."

"Don’t forget your promise..."

"..."

// ----------

"A burning feather amidst a blue, white, and red sky..."

// ----------

Drygut cracked his eyes open, noticing his surroundings bathed in a crimson glow that illuminated his pupils, a reflection of the dying flames of the campfire a few meters away. Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted a Kirin curled up among her feathers, sleeping peacefully.

He exhaled sharply, letting out a frustrated "Suhhh..."

The winds of fate had dragged him into an unacceptable situation. This was the second time in his life he faced something so unpleasant in such a short span, and he couldn’t help but wonder if bad luck was chasing him.

"Suhhh..." he repeated, this time with more annoyance. He tried to close his eyes, forcing himself to sleep, but the restlessness in his mind wouldn’t let him.

Awake and in a foul mood, he plucked a few of his feathers and threw them into the fire. The flames, fueled by the new fuel, crackled, spreading a bit more warmth around him.

Nothing had gone as expected, he thought, tucking his neck into his plumage. He was in a clearing in a dense forest, near a river. He had been there for five days since he regained consciousness after his failed and reckless stunt over the burning village. A maneuver that would surely have cost him his life if not for...

"Beetroot... beetroot... give me... beetroot..." murmured the Kirin beside him, waving her hooves in the air, lost in an adorable sleep.

Drygut’s neck flushed a deeper red as the desire to devour that small and annoying creature grew within him, fueled by the wounded pride of being saved by the self-proclaimed "Kirin." Or maybe, it was simply signs that his recovery was nearly complete, a spirit in a healthy body starting to feel hunger and the longing to fly again.

However, he managed to contain those impulses, and gratitude had nothing to do with it.

A persistent doubt gnawed at him, invading his thoughts day and night since he woke up. He couldn’t make sense of it, no matter how much he reasoned it out.

"How did you heal me?" Drygut wondered, watching the Kirin, who was rolling on the ground like a worm in the middle of a pleasant dream.

The pain and trauma of the wound on his chest were still vivid in his memory. He could clearly recall the cold metal embedded in his gullet, deep in an extremely delicate place. Even if, by some miracle, the steel hadn’t damaged any of his organs, the resulting wound would have tested even the most skilled of surgeons, leaving him in a critical state for weeks.

And yet, Drygut’s current condition didn’t match that image.

Only five days had passed, and he already felt capable of flying again. He had walked without problems the day before and eaten two days after waking up. The wound was no more than a faint scar hidden among the singed feathers on his chest.

It was more than a miracle... it was unsettling. How could this be? Magic?

Drygut had never heard of ponies having magic capable of healing creatures like him. He knew they could heal each other and others similar to their kind. But not his. The hawk-pheasants were too large and different.

Even if ponies had such a power, the clan leader would know about it and would have kidnapped and enslaved them to serve, as they had done with other lesser races living in captivity in the secret farms of the great north.

But there had never been such interest from their leaders. Not a single rumor of anything like that.

Or maybe he was wrong. That creature kept insisting she was a Kirin. Aren’t Kirins a subspecies of pony? Then if that were the case, he didn’t know anything about Kirins.

"Upprrrrr..." Drygut murmured, scratching the feathers on his back with a thoughtful expression. Thinking so much was exhausting. He could simply ignore the mystery, devour the Kirin to leave no witnesses of the incident, and continue on his way, resuming his life.

But was that the right thing to do? The more he thought about it, the more he felt he would be making a grave mistake. It seemed like he had something important within his grasp, but he couldn’t see it, despite having it right in front of his beak.

Moreover, those dreams... memories of his past, of his father... those thoughts only heightened his apprehension.

"Auuuuu..." Drygut let out in frustration, shaking his head as a deep crack echoed in his gullet. The hunger had returned with force, and despite the doubts that plagued him, he knew he couldn’t wait another day in this state. He needed to find food on his own, and for that, he had to continue his journey east. If he couldn’t resolve the matter today, he would have no choice but to leave it behind.

With this determination and a simple plan in mind, Drygut cast a fierce glance at the Kirin asleep in his lap as the morning began to break through the clouds of the dark horizon.

// ----------

"You’re going to love the seven-colored soup I’m making! It has blue potatoes, carrots, beans, tomatoes, cabbage, and pumpkins. And the most important ingredient of all: beets! I love beets!" Autumn Blaze exclaimed, stirring the contents of the enormous cauldron with enthusiasm as she waved her wooden spoon. The apron she wore seemed like a minor accessory compared to the energy she radiated.

Not far away, Drygut, with his usual serious expression, watched her attentively from where he had spent the night, measuring each of her movements as the little Kirin prepared the day’s breakfast-lunch.

"A good breakfast is the key to a good day. In my tribe, we always say that and we live by it. I, for instance, get up very early every day, at six in the morning without fail, to prepare my meal! Then I take my walk around the village and greet everyone for the wonderful new day. I’m the only one who does it! Well, I think the tribe leader wakes up even earlier and does the same, though I’m not sure. I’d have to ask her when I get back..."

Autumn Blaze’s monologue continued unabated, as one-directional as it had been from the first day. At first, Drygut had endured the chatter due to his weakened state, but now it was becoming unbearable.

"...in the tribe, we also have food contests, like eating among embers, the boiling fast, and my favorites, beet feasts!" Autumn Blaze stopped for a moment to taste the soup with the spoon. Her face scrunched into a frown of disapproval. "I think it needs a bit more salt..."

This was the opportunity Drygut had been waiting for. As the Kirin turned away from the cauldron to check some supplies, the hawk-pheasant plucked one of his large feathers with his beak, aiming at the unsuspecting Kirin.

A precise shot to the left leg, and it would all be over. In a swift and calculated move, Drygut threw the feather like a dart.

"Haaaa... Jumm! How clumsy! Wrong bag, hahaha," Autumn Blaze exclaimed, giving a cheerful bounce before heading to another supply bag. Unaware, the feather had brushed past her, ending up lodged in the bag she had just checked.

"Purrrr..." Drygut clicked his beak, irritated. His shot had missed... Had the Kirin dodged it on purpose? He would have to try again.

With the Kirin still busy checking another bag, Drygut prepared once more.

"Ah, here’s the pan I was looking for!" Autumn Blaze exclaimed, waving the utensil in the air with enthusiasm. But, in one of her movements, a metallic sound resonated in the air. Upon inspecting the pan, Autumn discovered, with disappointment, that the handle had bent. "Seriously! I haven’t even used you and you’re already broken! What a scam, hu!"

Annoyed, the Kirin threw the pan towards a pile of discarded items not far away.

"Purrrr..." Drygut clicked his beak with more force, anger starting to show in his eyes. Another failed attempt, frustration bubbling inside him.

"Don’t worry, the food will be ready in a moment. Just give me a few seconds to sort this out..." said the Kirin, oblivious to the growing discomfort emanating from the enormous hawk-pheasant behind her.

The last seconds of patience Drygut had were quickly running out. He plucked another feather, determined not to miss this time...

// ---------------

It was just a few minutes before noon, and there were just a few loose feathers left on Drygut's back.

"...I don't understand why the townsfolk don't believe you were trying to save them. I saw you break the water tower in the center to put out the fire! Plus, you scared away the other townspeople so they wouldn't get trapped by the flames. Seriously, they should give you a hero's medal!"

Drygut, feeling utterly dejected and with a heavy heart, finished the meager breakfast-lunch prepared by his tireless caretaker.

After numerous failed attempts to harm Autumn Blaze and force her to reveal the secret of her miraculous healing, Drygut had given up. He concluded that the kirin had some kind of passive magic protecting her from projectiles. It wasn’t that unusual; after all, some creatures had similar abilities. Plus, he couldn’t imagine how such an innocent creature could have survived alone in the forest for so long without some kind of protection.

"...at least the mayor and some farmers give me food for you, although they could have given more... I think if you come with me to the village tomorrow, I'm sure you'll show everyone what a nice guy you are."

"SHUT UP!" Drygut would have liked to scream, but all that came out of his beak was a whiny, "Auuuu purpur..."

Autumn Blaze, unaware of the language of the hawk-eagles, interpreted the sound her way.

"Do you want more beets? I have plenty. They gave me sacks of them. Now that I think about it, I think it’s all the farmers grow, that and pumpkins. Do you like pumpkins? It would be great to know what you like so I can get you better food. Although, it would be even better if I could communicate with you better. I mean, it's hard to guess what you're thinking, uhmm..."

Pondering, Autumn Blaze began rummaging through her belongings. Drygut, on his part, turned his gaze toward the nearby forest, scrutinizing the shadows of the trees. He noticed several villagers watching him, all with weapons and ropes.

That kirin was too naïve, Drygut thought. He could see that the villagers didn’t trust her or her version of events. Probably the only reason they hadn’t attacked him earlier was because they had no way to confirm or disprove the story she had told.

Another reason might be that they feared him; having recovered so quickly, he was now a threat they didn’t know how to handle.

In any case, that was one more reason to get out of that place, which had turned into a disaster for him.

"Ah, I found it!" exclaimed Autumn Blaze enthusiastically, pulling out a book from her bag. "It’s my sign language manual for the deaf. In the kirin village, there was a time when no one spoke, so many learned to use signs to communicate. Although later, when we started speaking again, everyone forgot how to do it... and I did too... Well, relearning is never a bad thing!"

After reading the book for a while, Autumn Blaze began making gestures and striking strange poses with her limbs in an attempt to communicate with Drygut.

But for Drygut, this was the last straw. Pushing aside the empty cauldron with his wing, he stood up, spread his enormous wings, and let out a frustrated screech.

"Ahhh! Wait! I just wanted to say 'hello,' I didn’t insult you or anything, did I?"

At Autumn Blaze’s question, Drygut had no choice but to crouch down and start writing on the ground with one of his large talons.

Autumn Blaze, curious, read what Drygut had written.

"I understand... it's unbearable? Wait... you do understand me! And it’s unbearable not being able to talk to me? I can't believe it! Why didn’t you tell me before? Oh, wait... you couldn't... Never mind! This changes everything! I thought you didn’t understand me at all...!"

Drygut cursed in his language. What he had actually written was: "I understand, you’re unbearable."

Again, he tried to write on the ground, erasing the previous message and starting anew. Autumn Blaze, intrigued, leaned in to read.

"Do you want me to... scratch your neck with a knife?" she read aloud. "Do you have an itch on your neck? Ok, I can do that!"

"Cut your neck with a knife!" Drygut shouted in his language, but Autumn just looked at him with a smile, not understanding a word.

Annoyed and frustrated, Drygut collapsed to the ground, defeated. He no longer cared about anything else, only wanted to digest his food and get out of there. He wouldn’t eliminate the kirin; he didn’t even want to know what her meat tasted like.

As Drygut grumbled, Autumn Blaze rummaged through her things until she finally found the knife.

"Here it is! A brand-new and unused knife. Although, thinking about it, it feels very dangerous. But don’t worry, friend, now that we understand each other, just tell me what to do. Ahhh, how exciting!" exclaimed Autumn Blaze, becoming more enthusiastic.

Drygut looked at Autumn Blaze with a mix of desperation and resignation. He had no idea what to expect from the kirin, but by now, he was beyond caring. If he could leave without losing more feathers, he would consider the day a success.

But then, in the midst of Autumn Blaze’s clumsy excitement, the knife she was holding slipped from her hoof. Spinning through the air like a ruler, the sharp blade landed precisely on Drygut’s right talon, embedding itself like a fork in a pie.

Autumn Blaze's eyes widened, horrified by the accident caused by her carelessness, and she rushed over to Drygut to help.

"I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!" she exclaimed, flustered.

But Drygut didn’t feel attacked at all. The scales on his talons were thick, so the knife had barely made more than a scratch. What really bothered him was having Autumn Blaze so close to his feathers.

"Uprrr..." he let out a threatening croak.

"Wait! Don’t get angry! I’ll fix it in a moment!" With quick movements, the kirin removed the knife from Drygut’s talon and, placing some of her saliva on the minor wound, put one of her hooves on top.

Just as Drygut was about to grab her with his beak, he stopped when he saw a sudden pink flame enveloping his right talon for just a moment.

A moment later, the kirin withdrew her hoof from that part of Drygut’s body. The wound had disappeared.

Drygut, astonished, could barely process what had just happened.

"Surprising, isn’t it?! What would my parents say if they knew that, besides theater, I'm also really good at medicine! Oh, wait, I did tell them before I left... You wouldn’t believe how proud they were! They practically didn’t want me to go, haha!" Autumn Blaze exclaimed, shaking her playful mane, her face glowing with happiness.

But for Drygut, a big question had been answered, and yet, another, even bigger one began to form... a question whose answer could resolve the greatest mystery of his species...

"On the other hand... look at this!" Autumn Blaze exclaimed, frowning as she picked up the metal object she had dropped earlier. "This knife has an awful handle, it’s just made of cane wood! Seriously! I’ll never deal with diamond dogs again, I swear."

Very upset, Autumn Blaze turned into fire for a moment, revealing her other angry form. In a flash, the piece of metal burned in the flames of her hoof, melting and disintegrating in an instant.

Once the knife was gone, Autumn Blaze returned to being the same smiling kirin she was before.

"No more accidents around here! Uh... is something wrong?" asked the kirin, puzzled by the strange expression on Drygut’s face. Although reading his expressions was difficult, the shine in the hawk-eagle’s eyes spoke for itself.

"Do you feel sick?" asked the kirin.

But Drygut didn’t hear those words; in his mind, other words echoed...

// ----------

"A burning feather in a blue, white, and red sky... wrapped in the fire we carry within, a burning will like the sun that we deliver each generation, a flame capable of melting steel and healing any wound it causes in our hearts. It is the fire that would ignite a divine feather."

That’s what Drygut’s father had revealed to his son shortly after dinner, following his encounter with the sky god.

// ----------

"I don’t know if I’m ready for this... I think it’s best if you leave me here. I was planning to visit some friends further west, you know?"

Drygut paid no attention to the kirin’s excuses at his feet. He flapped his wings, ready to leave. He had made a significant effort to communicate with her earlier, and this was all he would do to make the journey as bearable as possible for both of them.

He had no time. He needed to depart immediately.

"Uaaahhhh!" screamed the massive thunderbird, flapping his wings harder. Autumn Blaze stepped back nervously.

"I’m serious! I don’t think I’m made for flying. Well, I did want to travel the world, but I thought I’d use my hooves for that. They make me feel safer and..."

Drygut had had enough. With a quick peck, he grabbed the kirin trying to escape from him. Ignoring her desperate cries, Drygut proceeded to run along the riverbank, flapping his wings to catch the right air.

The path along the riverbank grew wider and noisier. The waters became turbulent, and the air filled with a fresh, neutral humidity.

"Haaaaaaa!" Autumn Blaze shouted louder as she saw the huge waterfall they were heading towards. "I don’t want to see, please stop!"

But Drygut didn’t stop. He ran faster, and suddenly, the ground disappeared.

Autumn Blaze closed her eyes as the world around her continued to move in an invisible transition. She could clearly feel the whistling wind ruffling her mane and coursing through her fur. She was terrified. She kept screaming, but after several minutes, she finally fell silent, frightened, and opened one eye to observe her surroundings.

The ground was far below, and the winding river looked like a shiny ribbon reflecting the sunlight.

"For all the theaters... I’m flying! I’m flying!" she shouted euphorically, feeling one with the sky.

Drygut couldn’t help but laugh at the look of surprise on her face. But soon, a more amusing idea came to mind. In a swift motion, the thunderbird released the kirin from his beak.

All of Autumn Blaze’s joy vanished in an instant, and terror returned.

"Ahhhhh!" she screamed as she fell, but before she could start praying to the spirits of her ancestors, a giant shadow appeared above her and caught her in its claws.

"Ah, ah, ah, ah..." she gasped, still shaken from the fall, as she found herself surrounded by the robust fingers of one of Drygut’s talons.

"Clo, clo, clo, clo," the thunderbird mocked.

"It’s not funny! Friends don’t do that!" Autumn Blaze protested through tears, but Drygut just laughed even more.

For the first time in a long while, Drygut laughed sincerely and without the suffocating hunger he used to carry. He felt truly free... alive, not younger or healthier, of course, but with a true purpose.

To be with his people, no, rather to be with his family and tell them... what he had found. And what he would do next...

"Uaaaa..." he cried out, reflecting his determination with a long, resolute scream.

The great bird continued to flap his wings, rising higher and higher into the sky, surpassing the height of all the clouds.

"Wait... are we heading north? Wow! I’ve always wanted to go there. Well, I’ve also wanted to go further south. Although I think I remember that the kirin have a family branch up north, oh my goodness! I’m going to meet my relatives! Yeees," Autumn Blaze exclaimed with enthusiasm.

Drygut didn’t respond to the kirin’s chatter. Although he did have a direction in mind... the great north.

On a bright afternoon, Drygut’s shadow faded among the tall clouds. He flew faster and faster, heading toward a distant and unknown destination...

But this would not be a journey he would make alone. Now, accompanied by an unexpected companion, Drygut could finally feel the faint warmth of the burning spirit his father once tried to give him.
